# echo "- - -" >  /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
The three dash ("-  -  -") of the command act as wildcards meaning rescan everything. Remember that the three values normally stand for channel, SCSI target ID, and LUN.

# echo "c t l" >  /sys/class/scsi_host/hosth/scan
where

h is the HBA number
c is the channel on the HBA
t is the SCSI target ID
l is the LUN.


What is Sticky Bit?
***********************
The sticky bit is used to indicate special permissions for files and directories. If a directory with sticky bit enabled will restrict deletion of the file inside it. It can be removed by root, owner of the file or who have to write permission on it.

chmod +t tecadmin.txt

chmod 1777 tecadmin.txt

What is SUID (setuid)?
**************************
If SUID bit is set on a file and a user executed it. The process will have the same rights as the owner of the file being executed

Mehtod 1:

# chmod u+s tecadmin.txt
# ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt
Method 2:

# chmod 4655 tecadmin.txt
# ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rwSr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt

What is SGID (setgid)?
*************************
If SGID bit is set on any directory, all subdirectories and files created inside will get same group ownership as the main directory, it doesn't matter who is creating.

Here is the implementation of SGID on directory on Linux system.


# chmod g+s /test/
# ls -ld /test
drwxrwsrwx 2 root root 4096 Mar  8 03:12 /test
Now swich to other user and create a file in /test directory.

# su - tecadmin
$ cd /test/
$ touch tecadmin.net.txt
$ ls -l tecadmin.net.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tecadmin root 0 Mar  8 03:13 tecadmin.net.txt

LVREDUCE steps

unmount the file system for reducing.----> umount /mnt
Check the file system after unmount.--->  e2fsck -ff /dev/amanvg/amanlv
Reduce the file system.---> resize2fs /dev/amanvg/amanlv 500M
Reduce the Logical Volume size than Current size.---->  lvreduce -L 500M /dev/amanvg/amanlv
Recheck the file system for error.--->  e2fsck -ff /dev/amanvg/amanlv
Remount the file-system back to stage. ----> mount /dev/amanvg/amanlv /mnt

ACL
******

Creating and Managing FACL

The setfacl command is used to set ACL on the given file. To give a rw access to user john on the file /tmp/test :
# setfacl -m u:john:rw /tmp/test

The -m option tells setfacl to modify ACLs on the file(s) mentioned in command line. Instead of user john we can have a group to have a specific permission on the file 
# setfacl -m g:accounts:rw /tmp/test

FACLs for multiple user and groups can also be set with single command :
# setfacl -m u:john:rw,g:accounts:rwx /tmp/test

To create a default FACL on a directory :
# setfacl -m default:u:john:rw /accounts

To remove ACLs, use the setfacl command with -x option :
# setfacl -x u:john /tmp/test
